// Interviewed last week just go notice of my rejection. Got asked a simple question O(n) solution, basically the question was given a set of moves write a function that could encode a move and also a function execute the move if already encoded in memory.

// My answer conssited of using a dictionary to store moves which are just strings, keys -> string, values being the move name

// store all of the incoming inputs into memory and then search then iterate of your dictionary values to see if the last kth inputs to see if a move has been registered in the dictionary already, (k being the size of each value in your move dictionary)

// In all cool interview, the interviewer wasnt the most familiar with python, so she may have been confused about my implementation.
