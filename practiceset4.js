// Task 1: Simple; solution: difference array.
// Task 2: Simple; solution: sort, double pointer.
    // The second question does not need to be sorted, just scan it once. 
    // The number scanned, the number of occurrences is recorded in a dictionary. 
    // Every time, check whether target-stockProfit[i] already exists in the dictionary, 
    // and then adjust the dictionary accordingly. Time and space complexity are 
    // linear, faster than sort
// Task 3: Write a BST and requires O(1) operation After getting the subtree sum
